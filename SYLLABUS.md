## Course Overview

Humans are the only species on earth with the ability to completely reshape the planet through imagination. 🐒 <br>
We can dream, design and invent new technologies that dramatically impact the earth and those living on it. Today, the modern landscape of design and fabrication technologies are reshaping the world in incredible ways. How will you, as an artist or designer, leverage these tools in order to produce meaningful designs? This is a question we will critically examine throughout this course. 

In this studio/performance-oriented class, we will focus on designing and modeling 3D objects for fabrication. We will explore workflows that allow you to take sketches, photographs and scans into a 3D environment, and then edit those designs order to manufacture them using 3D printers, and related fabrication hardware. We will also explore methods of texturing, lighting and rendering design concepts in order to create photo-realistic (or even abstract/artistic) representations of designs for purposes of documentation, visual communication, or even as part of other creative workflows.

## Aims & Objectives

By the end of this course you should be familiar with artists, designers and engineers leveraging modern fabrication tools in their practice, and be able to apply basic 3D modling, rendering and fabrication techniques in your own work.

👀 **This course we will explore:** 
* Basic Technique Modeling Objects in 3D 
* Fabrication of Objects using 3D Printers
* Rendering Concepts/Designs for Presentation

A lecture or demonstration will usually begin each class period, of which students are
encourage to take notes. Demos may be reviewed later in the class or briefly at the
beginning of the next class. Although the projects are diverse in design and content,
they are designed to progressively build skills and ideas. All projects are designed to
establish the concept of the computer as a creative tool that allows universal integration
of media. Students will complete 3 projects. Some classes will be designated as lab
days, giving students time to work on their projects. Students will be required to attend
lab days.

## Course Schedule & Class Resources

### [Course Schedule](https://github.com/mmansion/UT_FMX_213/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md)
* This is a dynamic course that we will adapt and amend at times to improve the overall learning experience. This means the schedule will change and should be checked regularly!

### [Class Resources](https://github.com/mmansion/UT_FMX_213/blob/master/RESOURCES.md)
* This is an ongoing list of resources. It will be updated regularly. 


## Required Materials

Your materials will largely depend on their proposed projects, however a few things are commom to the entire course.

* Personal laptop capable of running course software / access to computer lab
* Fusion 360 by Autodesk <sub>([see course resources](https://github.com/mmansion/UT_FMX_213/blob/master/RESOURCES.md))</sub>
* Adobe CC: Primarily Photoshop and Illustrator
* MeshMixer <sub>([see course resources](https://github.com/mmansion/UT_FMX_213/blob/master/RESOURCES.md))</sub>
* A sketchbook / journal
* A process blog
* Flash drive/ external hard drive (128G+)
* 3 Button Mouse

## Participating & Assessment

### Attendance
This is a performance-based class, and interaction with peers and the professor cannot
be duplicated outside of class. Regular class participation and continuous faculty
evaluation are crucial elements of the learning process. One cannot participate, or
receive feedback on one's work, if one is absent. Attendance is mandatory. If you are
absent, it is your responsibility to acquire any material that you have missed, not the
professor's responsibility. Coming to class late (after roll call), leaving early, failing to be
prepared for class, or failing to fully participate in class, will count as an absence.

| Attendance  | |
| :---   | -------------   |
| <sub>1-3 Absences</sub> | <sub>0 points subtracted from final course grade</sub> |
| <sub>4 Absences</sub>  | <sub>10 points subtracted from final course grade</sub> |
| <sub>5 Absenses</sub>  | <sub>20 points subtracted from final course grade</sub> |
| <sub>6 Absenses</sub>  | <sub>30 points subtracted from final course grade</sub> |
| <sub>7 Absenses+</sub> | <sub>Automatic Failure. No Exceptions</sub> |


```
It is the responsibility of the student to initiate and maintain communication with the
professor in case of an unusual circumstance. Absenses can beIf you are absent it is your responsibility to determine what you missed and coordinate with your classmates to make up the work.
```

* #### Excused Absences

  * Excused absences include:

    * Court-imposed legal obligations (e.g., jury duty and subpoenas)
    * Medical procedure
    * Required participation in University-sponsored events
    * (e.g. performances, athletic events, academic research presentations)
    * Observation of religious holy days
    * Requirements of military service
    * Unforeseen emergencies such as illness, injury, hospitalization, deaths in the immediate family, consequences of severe weather and other crises.

```
Students should contact instructors as soon as possible in these cases.
Instructors may require documentation or verification to excuse unscheduled
absences.
** Employment schedules, athletic conditioning and practice schedules and
personal appointments are not valid reasons for excused absences.
