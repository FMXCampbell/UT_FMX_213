## Description

Humans are the only species on earth with the ability to completely reshape the world through imagination. 🐒🐒🐒 
We can dream, design and invent new technologies that dramatically impact the planet and those living on it. Today, the modern landscape of design and fabrication technologies are reshaping the world in incredible ways. How will you, as an artist or designer, leverage these tools in order to produce meaningful designs? This is a question we will critically examine throughout this course. 

In this studio/performance-oriented class, we will focus on designing and modeling 3D objects for fabrication. We will explore workflows that allow you to take sketches, photographs and scans into a 3D environment, and then edit those designs order to manufacture them using 3D printers, and related fabrication hardware. We will also explore methods of texturing, lighting and rendering design concepts in order to create photo-realistic (or even abstract/artistic) representations of designs for purposes of documentation, visual communication, or even as part of other creative workflows.

## Aims & Objectives

By the end of this course you should be familiar with artists, designers and engineers leveraging modern fabrication tools in their practice, and be able to apply basic 3D modling, rendering and fabrication techniques in your own work.

This course will explore:
* Basic Technique Modeling Objects in 3D
* Fabrication of Objects using 3D Printers
* Rendering Concepts/Designs for Presentation

* Explore various applications for 3D printing
& 3D Modeling and Design
