## Description

Humans are the only species on earth with the ability to completely reshape the world through imagination. We can dream, design and invent new technologies that dramatically impact the planet and those living on it. Today, the modern landscape of design and fabrication technologies are reshaping the world in incredible ways. How will you, as an artist or designer, leverage these tools in order to produce meaningful designs? This is a question we will critically examine throughout this course.

In this studio production class, we will focus on designing and modeling 3D objects for fabrication. We will explore workflows that allow you to take sketches, photographs and scans into a 3D environment, and then edit those designs order to manufacture them using 3D printers, and related fabrication hardware. We will also explore methods of texturing, lighting and rendering design concepts in order to create photo-realistic (or even abstract/artistic) representations of designs for purposes of documentation, visual communication, or even as part of other creative workflows.

3D Printing & Fabrication Resources

* #### Fusion 360
  * Fusion 360TM is the first 3D CAD, CAM, and CAE tool of its kind. It connects your entire product development process in a single cloud-based platform that works on both Mac and PC.
  * [Free Student Sign Up](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators)
  * [Lynda.com - Fusion 360 Essential Training (Free for UT Studens - See Mikhail for Details)](https://www.lynda.com/Fusion-360-tutorials/Fusion-360-Essential-Training-REVISION/5034167-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a1%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3afusion+360%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2)


* Good for small to medium-size fabrication projects.

* #### MeshMixer
  * Meshmixer is a free tool for working with mesh models. It is great for mashing together existing meshes and also for preparing files for printing or fabrication. Mesh mixer is an organic modeling tool.
