Look around. Objects are everywhere. In the built-environment nearly everything we see, touch or experience is someone's design project! ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯

In this assignment we will explore the process of modeling and fabricating objects by making a replica of something we find. In our study, we will learn a common "design for fabrication" process, by: 1) measuring; 2) sketching; 3) modeling; and then 4) fabricating.

Start by finding 3 (or more) simple found objects that are around 6in<sup>3</sup>, or smaller. We should start from something simple and relativaly "printable". What is printable you ask? We will discuss this in class; and please refer to the resources page to see what things are important to consider. Bring your found objects to class, and we discuss their qualities and merits for this exercise. **You will select 1 object for this project.**

Once you've selected an object to model, you will start measuring and recording its measurements using [calipers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calipers). This is the "dimensioning" process.

After you have the basic dimensions recorded, you will sketch your object's profiles and outlines in 2-dimensions, using either Illustrator or Fusion 360. You'll need to considering how the 3D object can be represented with just flat lines and profiles. Beginning with simple line-sketches is a very common way to model 3D objects in the industry. This will take some practice and we will look at common ways to approach and think about this in class. 

When we can represent an object's main features as 2D sketches and outlines, we will transfer your 2D drawings into 3D dimensions and models by way of extruding, cutting and otherwise shaping. We will utilize the 3D tools in Fusion 360. There are a number of features we explore to create a final shape. 

Finally, we will attempt to fabricate our objects using 3D printers. Beforehand we will visit the UT Fab Lab, and learn about the capabilities of the school's 3D printers. We will also explore various strategies and methods for getting your objects to come out successfully, and learn about what makes an object "printable". Visit the [resources page](https://github.com/mmansion/UT_FMX_213/blob/master/RESOURCES.md) to get details on Fab Lab hours, location and more.

```IMPORTANT``` - Be sure to document your process throughout this assignment. Our end goal is to have a classroom critique, where we compare our 3D fabricated models to the original found objects, and then discuss: 1) what worked; 2) didn't work; and 3) what can be done differently in the future for better results.

#### Final Deliverables

**`Materials Due by class on Thursday, 2/20)`**

Bring your found objects and the 3D-printed replica to class. We will discuss these as a group in a round-table critique.

The following materials should be submitted to *mmansion@ut.edu* :

**1. A zip folder containing the following:**
  * Photo of your found object
  * Image of the modeled object
  * Photo of the printed object
  * STL file of the model (exported from Fusion 360)

**2. A link you your blog post for project 1, with the following:**

  * The above-mentioned images of your object (original / modeled / fabricated)
  * Brief paragraph describing
    * what is the object is
    * how closely could you came to resembling the original
    * what you think worked and  didn't work
    * what would you do different next time?
    * any other details you find relevant
