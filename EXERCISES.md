## Exercise 1

For this exercise we will break into groups. Each group is assigned a number. Each number corresponds to a different image below.

Working with your team, you will model the objects in the image. You don't need to be accurate for this exercise. 
Work together and develop a strategy, then go for it. Use the sketching and modeling tools, and practices the techniques 
you already know. Every 10 minutes we will switch the person in your group driving the software. This way everyone gets hands on time practicing.

The images are simple isometric representations, soeverything can be created using relatively simple shapes.
