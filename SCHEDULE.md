## Week 1

**Tuesday 1/21** 
* Introductions
* Course Overview

**Thursday 1/23**
* Intro to Fusion 360
* Dimensioning Objects
* 2D Sketching for 3D Modeling


| ```ASSIGNMENT - DUE TUE 1/28``` |
| :---     |
|**Overview**<br>
   <sub>- For next Tuesday, please bring three (3) *SIMPLE* "found objects" to class.</sub><br>
   <sub>- We will discuss the merits of these objects, and considered  how they can be modeled and fabricated on a 3D printer. You will select 1 of these objects use in [Project 1](https://ultimaker.com/en/resources/22015-designing-for-printability), which we will discuss in class. The goal will be to dimension, model and then produce an object as a clone that you can hold in your hand. We will compare the results against the original object.<br></sub>|
|**Tips for selecting objects**<br>
   <sub>- Choose objects that are simple in form, and can be modeled as one solid object.</sub><br>
   <sub>- Avoid things that need to be produced in parts as much as possible (ok, if you want a challenge!)</sub><br>
   <sub>- Consider simple handheld tools, decroative items, jewelry, or functional items like bottles and cups</sub><br>
   <sub>- Try to keep the size of your found object to a printable size (at 1:1 ratio) that doesn't require scaling. (150mm<sup>3</sup> / 6"<sup>3)</sup></sub>|
