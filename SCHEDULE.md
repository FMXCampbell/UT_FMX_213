### Week 1

#### Tuesday 1/21
* Introductions
* Course Overview

#### Thursday 1/23
* Intro to Fusion 360
* Dimensioning Objects
* 2D Sketching for 3D Modeling
* **Assignment for Next Class**
  * For next Tuesday, please bring three (3) *SIMPLE* "found objects" to class. We will discuss the merits of these objects, and considered  how they can be modeled and fabricated on a 3D printer. You will select 1 of these objects use in Project 1, which we will discuss in class. The goal will be to dimension, model and then produce an object as a clone that you can hold in your hand. We will compare the results against the original object.
  * *Tips for selecting objects*
    - Choose objects that are simple in form, and can be modeled as one solid object.
    - Avoid things that need to be produced in parts as much as possible (ok, if you want a challenge!)
    - Consider simple handheld tools, decorative items, jewelry, or functional items like bottles and cups
    - Try to keep the size of your found object to a printable size (at 1:1 ratio) that doesn't require scaling (150mm<sup>3</sup> / 6"<sup>3)
