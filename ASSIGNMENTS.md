#### Modeling Found Objects

In this assignment we will explore modeling objects from real life in accurate dimension. We will take found objects, and record their measurements using calipers. Then we will sketch their dimensions in 2-dimensions. Then we will transfer our 2D sketches into 3D using modeling software, exploring a common workflow for design and fabrication (2D to 3D). Finally, we will attempt to fabricate our objects on 3D printers, comparing the cloned objecet to the original.
