Look around. Objects are everywhere. In the built-environment nearly everything we see, touch or experience is someone's design project! ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯

In this assignment we will explore the process of modeling and fabricating real-life objects. In our study, we will learn a common "design for fabrication" process, by: 1) measuring; 2) sketching; 3) modeling; and then 4) fabricating.

Start by finding 3 (or more) found objects that are around 6in<sup>3</sup>, or smaller. You will bring your found objects to class, and we discuss their qualities and merits for this exercise.

Once you've selected your object, you will start measuring and recording its measurements using [calipers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calipers). This is the "dimensioning" process.

Once you have the basic dimensions records, you will sketch the object's profiles and outlines in 2-dimensions, considering how the 3D object can be represented with just flat lines or profiles. This will take some practice and we will look at common ways to approach and think about this in class. Beginning with simple line-sketches is a very common way to model 3D objects in the industry.

Once we can represent an object's main features as 2D sketches and outlines, we will transfer our 2D drawings into 3D models by way of extruding and shaping. Using the 3D tools in Fusion 360, you can utilize a number of operations to create the final shape (covered in class). 

Finally, we will attempt to fabricate our objects using 3D printers. Beforehand we will visit the UT Fab Lab, and learn about the capabilities of the 3D printers. We will explore strategies and methods for getting your objects to come out, and learn about what makes an object "printable". Open hours to the labs

Be sure to document your process throughout this assignment. The end goal is to have a classroom critique, where we compare our 3D fabricated models to the original found objects, and then discuss: 1) what worked; 2) didn't work; and 3) what can be done differently in the future for better results.
