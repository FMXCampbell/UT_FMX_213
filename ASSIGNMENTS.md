## Project 1

### Modeling & Fabricating Found Objects

In this assignment we will explore modeling objects from real life in accurate dimension. We will take found objects, and record their measurements using [calipers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calipers). Then we will sketch their profiles in 2-dimensions. Once we can represent the main features and outlines in "sketches", we will transfer our 2D drawings into 3D models. This a common workflow for design and fabrication (sketching in 2D, and extruding/modeling in 3D). Finally, we will attempt to fabricate our objects on 3D printers, comparing the modeled objecet to the original.
